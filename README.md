# react_blog_wassell_backend
The backend Express.js server for the React Blog based on Shaun Wassell's LinkedIn Learning Course

Currently using a local MongoDB as the backing database.

Thoughts after completing:

Overall this is a decent course for getting comfortable with the tooling for building a full-stack application. It took me significantly longer due to my rustiness with Typescript+React. Working with MongoDB was relatively easy. It's been quite some time since I tried out MongoDB, and found the process of setup to be user friendly. Integrating MongoDB was pretty easy as well for this simple use case.
